# Analysis-on-US-Accidents-Dataset
Analysis on US accidents dataset for a period of 4 years (2016-2019).


My interest on data analysis had pushed me to explore on open source datasets and I've performed a case study on this interesting huge dataset from Kaggle called "Us accidents dataset" using python in Google colab.


Insights:
- Less than 4.5% of cities or a total of 494 cities had more than 1000 accidents in 4 years.
- There is no New York city included in the dataset.
- More than 4400 cities have less than 10 accidents in this period.
- During weekends, most of the accidents happened during 06:00 to 09:00 and 15:00 to 18:00. This is may be because this is time for office & home commutes.
- Weekend chart is bell curve quite opposite to weekday accidents and most of the accidents happened betweek 10:00 to 15:00.
- Accidents were more in the coastel areas and central regions seem to be less accident prone zones.
